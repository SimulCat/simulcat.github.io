## Building a VR Simulation of Crystal Scattering

A 1923 paper by physicist William Duane “The Transfer in Quanta of Radiation Momentum to Matter,” describes a novel quantum model for the exchange of momentum between a crystal lattice and incident X-Ray radiation.

A few years prior Sir William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg had been awarded the [1915 Nobel prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1915/summary/) for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays".

The scientific basis of Duane’s model lay in putting together two concepts transforming physics at the time: 
	-X-Rays transfer energy and momentum in “quanta” (photons) as per Albert Einstein’s 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect.
	-Momentum exchanges with and within periodic systems follow the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule. 

Neils Bohr and Arnold Sommerfeld refined Bohr’s original 1913 discovery of the quantization of angular momentum for circular atomic orbitals into a more general momentum quantization condition that applied to elliptical orbitals and relativistic situations.

Duane’s novel idea was to apply the rule in the context of the exchange of linear momentum with a crystal lattice, as opposed to the cyclic situation of atomic orbitals of electrons.
