A blog giving background to VRChat worlds that simulate and demonstrate some ideas around the foundations of quantum theory through applying a much-overlooked approach to quantum interpretation that began with a brilliant quantized crystal diffraction model proposed by William Duane in 1923 and later integrated into quantum theory by Carolyne Van Vliet․

Significantly Van Vliet identified how the quantum formalism could allow quantum interactions to be modelled with an extended scattering object reacting coherently rather than the incident particle 'de-localizing' or splitting into multiple paths⁄realities․
