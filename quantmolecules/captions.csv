A pattern formed by molecules undergoing quantum scattering in an experiemnt at the Vienna Center of Quantum Science and Technology, University of Vienna, published in Nature Nanotechnology March 2012.
The experiment demonstrates how massive particles produce interference patterns consistent with the quantum principle of wave-particle duality.
A feature of this experiment is that it shows how such patterns form one particle at a time.
The molecular source utilses a laser that evaporates molecules off a thin molecular coating on a window inside a vacuum chamber. 
A 3Î¼m collimation slit filters the molecuels into a narrow beam. 
After about 500mm (L1), the particles are incident on a grating with 100nm aperture spacing.
After another 560mm (L2), the scattered beam is deposited on a target window where the molecules are illumated by an infrared laser. 
Under the infrared laser the deposited molecules fluoresce, and the resulting pattern is imaged by a CCD camera.
